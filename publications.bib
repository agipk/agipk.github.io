	abstract = {Paratransit in Malang has its own irregular characteristics, same as in other cities in the world. It is tough to recognize the exact operational time, availability, and estimated travel time when using paratransit. The information about paratransit can be only obtained by making predictions due to its irregular characteristics. This research examined the importance of a system that can collect paratransit travel data as a basis for making predictions. Therefore, this research proposes the design of a paratransit travel data collection system by utilizing smartphone GPS and REST web service. To determine the position of the paratransit, the researchers used the concept of circle-based geofencing which is called pseudo-stop. The initial results obtained from the experiment indicated the influence of tracking intervals and radius of pseudo-stop on effectiveness and efficiency of the system. The shorter the tracking interval, the higher the tendency of the pseudo-stop radius value to decrease, resulting in decreased effectiveness and increased efficiency. Otherwise, the wider the tracking interval, the higher the tendency of the pseudo-stop radius value to be greater, resulting in increased effectiveness and decreased efficiency. In spite of periodically accessing location providers, the energy usage is quite low.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the development of text-based domain-specific modeling language. The covered domain is representational state transfer (REST) architectural style. With domain-specific modeling language, we can develop software in a higher level of abstraction than general-purpose programming language. Domain analysis is performed to classify different kinds of resources into several resource types, namely resource, individual resource, projection resource, container resource, list resource, collection resource, transitional resource, and subresource. The design of modeling language is represented in metamodel and the implementation of modeling language is represented in EBNF-like grammar using Xtext domain-specific language (DSL) framework. In conclusion, we have successfully developed a domain-specific modeling language and its validators. The problem faced lies in the code generator in the behavioral modeling aspect, especially the business logic. It is very difficult to generalize the various business logic at a high level of abstraction. So that in the future, the modeling language needs to be limited to a narrower domain so that it can be fully executable.},

	abstract = {Badut Temple as one of the tourist destinations in Malang and the oldest temple in East Java has a problem in the form of the existence of an information board that only explains some of the objects in the Badut Temple. Whereas the results of observations show that temple visitors have a curiosity about existing objects and tend to explore the meaning of the objects themselves rather than reading the existing information boards. A solution is needed to convey the information contained in the Badut Temple object by combining the gamification method. The development of the Nusantarian application uses the waterfall software development method by using tests in the form of functional testing, usability, and compatibility. The choice of the waterfall method is because the functional requirements of the system have been clearly defined from the start. The results of functional testing show that almost all functional requirements can run well except for functional requirements that utilize GPS sensors because the accuracy of mobile GPS is sometimes inaccurate and precise. While the application compatibility test can run well at least on the Android Pie version. And the usability test got a success rate of 96.67\% and based on the System Usability Scale (SUS) it produced an average value of 76 which was in adjective good or acceptable. Based on distance analysis, The average respondent found objects within 2 â€“ 4 meters past or before the location of the original object. Also, the most frequent objects encountered by respondents were Perwara Temple and the Nandi statue. It is hoped that this research can be developed with a combination of other methods that can improve the weaknesses of the use of GPS sensors.},

	abstract = {Health services are one of the important factors for hospitals. Good and bad services provided will affect the image of the hospital itself. Increased activity in a hospital with limited service facilities will result in queues at the outpatient unit. This happened in Gatoel Mojokerto Hospital. Based on survey that has been conducted, there are 80\% of hospital visitors who experience a long queue when registering conventionally and 56\% have difficulty receiving information on the doctor's practice schedule. Thus, 94\% of patients require an online registration application. The purpose of this study is to make an online registration application to solve patient problems. This research uses waterfall method. In requirement analysis there are 11 functional and 2 non-functional requirements. At the design step, includes the design of use case diagrams, use case scenarios, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, pseudocode, class diagrams, databases, and interfaces. Then at the implementation step, it produces a database implementation and 12 interface. In the testing step, it is 100\% valid on black-box and compatibility. The usability test using SUS resulted in a score of 100 for the admin which was classified as grade A with best imaginable adjective ratings and a score of 88.12 for patients who were classified as grade B with adjective ratings excellent.},
