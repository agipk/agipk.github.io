abstract: Smartphones and their mobile applications have become an inseparable part
  of modern daily life. One of them is a public transportation app that helps people
  commute with public transportation. Many public transportation service providers
  have mobile applications as a companion for their customers to improve their quality
  of service. The application provides useful information and/or important features
  regarding their service, such as timetables or route finding for public transit.
  Such features run a slow algorithm to provide real-time or time-based information
  to the users. Dijkstra is one example of an algorithm that allows users to find
  the shortest path from one location to another in a public transit network. However,
  Dijkstra is categorized as a greedy algorithm because it looks at all possible solutions.
  It takes longer for Dijkstra to find the optimum solution when the number of points
  in a network graph is high. This study attempted to improve the overall route-finding
  processing time and reduce the memory footprint while keeping the visual cue of
  a route path reasonably consistent by utilizing Douglas-Peucker line simplification
  algorithm to simplify the path and reduce the number of points that Dijkstra algorithm
  processes. The result suggested that Douglas-Peucker simplification process took
  0.5% additional memory footprint and put 5.13% additional processing time into the
  overall route-finding processing time. However, it reduces the overall memory footprint
  and processing time by 72.56% and 80.83%, respectively. The result conveyed a significant
  improvement in the practical implementation of Douglas-Peucker algorithm to reduce
  the input for the Dijkstra algorithm in finding the optimal route, thereby improving
  the overall route-finding performance.
