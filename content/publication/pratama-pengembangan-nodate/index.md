abstract: Laziness in children often arises due to lack of motivation in doing something.
  In psychology, studies state that laziness in children arises due to the absence
  of habits in regular learning. To increase motivation, parents need to give a gift
  so that children have the will to do something. This is done to start getting children
  used to doing things. The provision of daily activity is a tool to get children
  used to doing daily activities. This research uses the Waterfall software development
  method. The method is chosen because the functional requirements of the system have
  been defined from the beginning and have no change. Tests conducted on the Daily
  Quest application are validation, usability, and compatibility testing. In validation
  testing results in a 100% success rate. Usability testing results in a success rate
  of 82.8% for the parent system and 91.6% for the child system. The system usability
  scale (SUS) method produces an average value of 66 in the parent system, classifying
  it into the C grade category, which is marginal. Whereas in the child system produces
  an average value of 73, classified into the category grade B- that is acceptable.
  In system compatibility testing, the Daily Quest application can only run well on
  Android Lollipop 5.0 (API level 21 or greater).
