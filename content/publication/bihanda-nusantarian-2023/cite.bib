 abstract = {Badut Temple as one of the tourist destinations in Malang and the oldest temple in East Java has a problem in the form of the existence of an information board that only explains some of the objects in the Badut Temple. Whereas the results of observations show that temple visitors have a curiosity about existing objects and tend to explore the meaning of the objects themselves rather than reading the existing information boards. A solution is needed to convey the information contained in the Badut Temple object by combining the gamification method. The development of the Nusantarian application uses the waterfall software development method by using tests in the form of functional testing, usability, and compatibility. The choice of the waterfall method is because the functional requirements of the system have been clearly defined from the start. The results of functional testing show that almost all functional requirements can run well except for functional requirements that utilize GPS sensors because the accuracy of mobile GPS is sometimes inaccurate and precise. While the application compatibility test can run well at least on the Android Pie version. And the usability test got a success rate of 96.67% and based on the System Usability Scale (SUS) it produced an average value of 76 which was in adjective good or acceptable. Based on distance analysis, The average respondent found objects within 2 â€“ 4 meters past or before the location of the original object. Also, the most frequent objects encountered by respondents were Perwara Temple and the Nandi statue. It is hoped that this research can be developed with a combination of other methods that can improve the weaknesses of the use of GPS sensors.},
