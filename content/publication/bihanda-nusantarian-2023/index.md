abstract: Badut Temple as one of the tourist destinations in Malang and the oldest
  temple in East Java has a problem in the form of the existence of an information
  board that only explains some of the objects in the Badut Temple. Whereas the results
  of observations show that temple visitors have a curiosity about existing objects
  and tend to explore the meaning of the objects themselves rather than reading the
  existing information boards. A solution is needed to convey the information contained
  in the Badut Temple object by combining the gamification method. The development
  of the Nusantarian application uses the waterfall software development method by
  using tests in the form of functional testing, usability, and compatibility. The
  choice of the waterfall method is because the functional requirements of the system
  have been clearly defined from the start. The results of functional testing show
  that almost all functional requirements can run well except for functional requirements
  that utilize GPS sensors because the accuracy of mobile GPS is sometimes inaccurate
  and precise. While the application compatibility test can run well at least on the
  Android Pie version. And the usability test got a success rate of 96.67% and based
  on the System Usability Scale (SUS) it produced an average value of 76 which was
  in adjective good or acceptable. Based on distance analysis, The average respondent
  found objects within 2 â€“ 4 meters past or before the location of the original object.
  Also, the most frequent objects encountered by respondents were Perwara Temple and
  the Nandi statue. It is hoped that this research can be developed with a combination
  of other methods that can improve the weaknesses of the use of GPS sensors.
