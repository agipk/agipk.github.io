abstract: Health services are one of the important factors for hospitals. Good and
  bad services provided will affect the image of the hospital itself. Increased activity
  in a hospital with limited service facilities will result in queues at the outpatient
  unit. This happened in Gatoel Mojokerto Hospital. Based on survey that has been
  conducted, there are 80% of hospital visitors who experience a long queue when registering
  conventionally and 56% have difficulty receiving information on the doctor's practice
  schedule. Thus, 94% of patients require an online registration application. The
  purpose of this study is to make an online registration application to solve patient
  problems. This research uses waterfall method. In requirement analysis there are
  11 functional and 2 non-functional requirements. At the design step, includes the
  design of use case diagrams, use case scenarios, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams,
  pseudocode, class diagrams, databases, and interfaces. Then at the implementation
  step, it produces a database implementation and 12 interface. In the testing step,
  it is 100% valid on black-box and compatibility. The usability test using SUS resulted
  in a score of 100 for the admin which was classified as grade A with best imaginable
  adjective ratings and a score of 88.12 for patients who were classified as grade
  B with adjective ratings excellent.
