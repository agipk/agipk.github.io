abstract: This paper discusses the development of text-based domain-specific modeling
  language. The covered domain is representational state transfer (REST) architectural
  style. With domain-specific modeling language, we can develop software in a higher
  level of abstraction than general-purpose programming language. Domain analysis
  is performed to classify different kinds of resources into several resource types,
  namely resource, individual resource, projection resource, container resource, list
  resource, collection resource, transitional resource, and subresource. The design
  of modeling language is represented in metamodel and the implementation of modeling
  language is represented in EBNF-like grammar using Xtext domain-specific language
  (DSL) framework. In conclusion, we have successfully developed a domain-specific
  modeling language and its validators. The problem faced lies in the code generator
  in the behavioral modeling aspect, especially the business logic. It is very difficult
  to generalize the various business logic at a high level of abstraction. So that
  in the future, the modeling language needs to be limited to a narrower domain so
  that it can be fully executable.
